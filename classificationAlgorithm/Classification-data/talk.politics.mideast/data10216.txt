edu vd cunixb cc columbia edu vedat dogan wrote in response to article mar urartu sdpa org dbd urartu sdpa org david davidian writes source adventures in the near east by a rawlinson jonathan cape bedford square london first published pages dd such a pile of garbage first off the above reference was first published dd in not and has pages not second upon checking page dd we are asked to believe vd no mr davidian vd it was first published in i have the book on my desk now vd vd and furthermore the book i have does not have pages either as you vd claimed mr davidian it has pages any question well it seems your book has its total page numbers closer to mine than the n crap posted by mr o boy please can you tell us why those quotes are crap because you do not like them because they really exist why as i said in my previous posting those quotes exactly exist in the source given by serdar argic you couldn t reject it in addition the author s preface was written on january but the book was published in here we go again in the book i have both the front page and the author s preface give the same year and january respectively anyone can check it at her his library if not i can send you the copies of pages please ask by sct i really don t care what year it was first published or what i care about is what the book writes about murders tortures et in the given quotes by serdar argic and your denial of these quotes and your groundless accussations etc dd i can provide gif postings if required to verify my claim vd what is new i will post a gif file but i am not going go through the effort to show there is some turkish modified re publication of the book like last time i claim i have a book in my hand published in first publication and it exactly has the same quoted info as the book published in serdar argic s reference has you couldn t reject it but now you are avoiding the real issues by twisting around let s see how you lie from non existing quotes to re publication first you said there was no such a quote in the given reference you called serdar argic a liar i said to you no mr davidian there exactly existed such a quote i even gave the call number page numbers you could t reject it and now you are lying again and talking about modified re published book without any proof how when where by whom etc by the way how is it possible to re publish the book in if it was first published in your claim i am sure that you have some pretty well suited theories as usual and i am ready to send the copies of the necessary pages to anybody who wants to compare the fact and mr davidian s lies i also give the call number and page numbers again for the library use which are r and the page numbers to verify the quotes and it is not possible that s text has pages mine has and yours has now are you claiming that there can t be such a reference by saying it is not possible if not what is your point differences in the number of pages mine was published in serdar argic s was in no need to use the same book size and the same letter charachter in both publications etc etc does it give you an idea the issue was not the number of pages the book has or the year first published and you tried to hide the whole point the point is that both books have the exactly the same quotes about how moslems are killed tortured etc by armenians and those quotes given by serdar argic exist it was the issue wasn t it you were not able to object it does it bother you anyway you name all these tortures and murders by armenians as a crap people who think like you are among the main reasons why the world still has so many craps in the any question c wwqa wl news cso uiuc edu hovig uxa cso uiuc edu hovig heghinian hmm turks sure know how to keep track of deaths but they seem to lose count around million well apparently we have another son of dro the butcher to contend with you should indeed be happy to know that you rekindled a huge discussion on distortions propagated by several of your contemporaries if you feel that you can simply act as an armenian governmental crony in this forum you will be sadly mistaken and duly embarrassed this is not a lecture to another historical revisionist and a genocide apologist but a fact i will dissect article by article paragraph by paragraph line by line lie by lie revision by revision written by those on this net who plan to prove that the armenian genocide of million turks and kurds is nothing less than a classic un redressed genocide we are neither in x soviet union nor in some similar ultra nationalist fascist dictatorship that employs the dictates of hitler to quell domestic unrest also feel free to distribute all responses to your nearest asala sdpa arf terrorists the armenian pseudo scholars or to those affiliated with the armenian criminal organizations armenian government got away with the genocide of million turkish men women and children and is enjoying the fruits of that genocide you and those like you will not get away with the genocide s cover up not a chance serdar argic we closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as ways of escape for the turks and then proceeded in the work of extermination ohanus appressian in soviet armenia today there no longer exists a single turkish soul sahak melkonian
