talk.politics.mideast	they were completely and systematically exterminated by armenians in article c xcu polaris async vt edu jfurr polaris async vt edu joel furr writes do it depew has shown himself to be unrepentant though embarrassed and still possessed of the same fucked up hubris laden self righteousness that the theory is that the hollering kills the spirit of the criminal nazi armenians of the asala sdpa arf terrorism and revisionism triangle now try dealing with the rest of what i wrote what is more the activities of the armenian government seem to have been efforts aimed at eradicating a race the turks or aimed at carrying out a one sided feud instead of being a struggle for liberation from the outset the efforts of the armenian revolutionaries within the ottoman borders took the form of terrorist and destructive actions aimed at mass murder cruelty and genocide so that no other interpretation of them is possible armenian activities started during the reign of abdulhamid ii as individual acts of terror and then developed into assassinations and surprise attacks the element of brute force in these activities increased steadily culminating in mass rebellions and widespread fighting during the first world war furthermore when the ottoman army withdrew from eastern anatolia after the sarikamis defeat armenian revolutionaries initiated a series of cruelties in this area although the russians occupied eastern anatolia as an enemy nevertheless they were constrained by the rules of war however when they returned to their country in after the revolution armenian revolutionaries were unchecked in this area for about a year until the ottoman forces returned to erzurum in during this period armenian revolutionaries executed massacres on the local people which is recorded in historical documents for example let us look at a report dated march which the commander of the third army submitted when he entered erzurum and erzincan they were completely and systematically destroyed and burned down by armenians even the trees were cut down and they are like a building entirely consumed by fire in every sense of the word as for the people who had been living in erzurum and erzincan those who were capable of fighting were taken away at the very beginning with the excuse of forced labor in road construction they were taken in the direction of sarikamis and annihilated when the russian army withdrew a part of the remaining people was destroyed in armenian massacres and cruelties they were thrown into wells they were locked in houses and burned down they were killed with bayonets and swords in places selected as butchering spots their bellies were torn open their lungs were pulled out and girls and women were hanged by their hair after being subjected to every conceivable abominable act a very small part of the people who were spared these abominations far worse than the cruelty of the inquisition resembled living dead and were suffering from temporary insanity because of the dire poverty they had lived in and because of the frightful experiences they had been subjected to including women and children such persons discovered so far do not exceed one thousand five hundred in erzincan and thirty thousand in erzurum all the fields in erzincan and erzurum are untilled everything that the people had has been taken away from them and we found them in a destitute situation at the present time the people are subsisting on some food they obtained impelled by starvation from russian storages left behind after their occupation of this area foreign observers who witnessed the events including russian officers who did not desert their lines submitted detailed reports proving the genocide to ottoman commanders who received them as prisoners of war what is most important is that they stated in their reports the massacres did not happen by chance but were planned at the end of the war the german author dr weiss
