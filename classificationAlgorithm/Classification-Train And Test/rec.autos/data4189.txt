thunder t bird sc it s a hell of a thing killing a man you take away all he has and all he s ever gonna have will munny unforgiven i am beyond the under age group but i have an experience a few years ago that might be interesting to you i owned a toyota celica gt i decided to buy myself a gift a more exotic car front runners included the toyota supra turbo and the porsche model years i narrowed it down to those two i liked the simplicity and handling and snob appeal too of driving a porsche the supra turbo was less money and had more features and performance almost a personal luxury car it had better acceleration and a higher top speed than the i was almost ready to give in to a buying impulse for the but i decided to stop by my insurance agent s office on the way i asked about what would happen to my rate with either car if you buy the supra your rate classification will be the same as the celica the celica was considered a subcompact and for that year was rated as one of the safest cars with a slight increase because the car will be years newer our lower risk division will continue to handle your account if you buy the porsche we ll have to change you to the standard higher rate company and your rate will double and if you go with a it s another story again we ll cover the rest of this year but cancel you after that but the supra is much faster than the and the is actually faster than the standard that doens t make sense that s what the book says we don t insure corvettes either for some reason the underwriters consider supras and their drivers as very traditional and conservative i eventually went with the supra for a number of reasons the porsche dealer had a nice salesman to get me interested but a tough high pressure guy in the back room at equal monthly payments it would have taken a year longer to pay for the porsche plus its higher insurance i concluded that the high insurance was related to probability of auto theft everyone s entitled to my opinion goldberg oasys dt navy mil imagination is more important than knowledge albert einstein i live in idaho when i was many years ago years i bought a trans am new insurance was about year when i turned it immediately dropped to year i had not had any accidents before or after this was strictly an age change that same rate stayed pretty much the same until i sold the car years ago my f pickup

no violations no accidents knock on wood mass one thing that makes a huge difference in mass is the town you live in i m personally in one of the best towns within reasonable distance of boston if i moved to the absolute best it would go down to about if i moved to the worst it would be also one accident and a couple of tickets would probably add another rv i have a mitsubishi eclipse turbo awd am years old and have no tickets that went on my record i live in illinois just outside of chicago and pay a year with full coverage at state farm i did get a small discount because of my alarm system a year i only live miles from chicago but if i actually lived in the city the price would be about a year i m over but in case you re interested anyway i m insuring a sho for month thats k personal k total k property with deductible glass and towing state farm unless you are under or have been driving for less than years i think you are being seriously ripped off i don t have one of the performance cars you listed but if your record is clean then you should not be paying over k did you try calling all the insurance dealers you could find although rates are supposed to be standardized i ve found that most places i initially call give me some ridiculously high quote and finaly i hit one that is much lower also i have changed insurance companies when the rate went up at renewal no accidents tickets car gets older to maintain a low rate you always have to be careful when it comes to insurance companies good luck serge
