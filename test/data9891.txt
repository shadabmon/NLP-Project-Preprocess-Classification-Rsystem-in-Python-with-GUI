about armenia were you expecting a different response here is another one source k s papazian patriotism perverted baikar press boston pages with appendix p third paragraph some real fighters sprang up from among the people who struck terror into the hearts of the turks within a few months after the war began these armenian guerrilla forces operating in close coordination with the russians were savagely attacking turkish cities towns and villages in the east massacring their inhabitants without mercy while at the same time working to sabotage the ottoman army s war effort by destroying roads and bridges raiding caravans and doing whatever else they could to ease russian occupation the atrocities committed by the armenian volunteer forces accompanying the russian army were so severe that the russian commanders themselves were compelled to withdraw them from the fighting fronts and sent them to rear guard duties the memoirs of many russian officers who served in the east at this time are filled with accounts of the revolting atrocities committed by these armenian guerrillas which were savage even by relatively primitive standards of war then observed in such areas journal de guerre du deuxieme d artillerie de forteresse russe d erzeroum p honored me by reproducing my text unfortunately he has still not produced the documents on jews in latvia instead he asks for my views on the turkish genocide well that debate seems to be going on in a few hundred other threads i ll let other people bring the usual charges try to debunk mutlu argic cosar a net wide terrorism triangle and their spurious evidence when that does ever happen look out the window to see if there is a non fascist x soviet armenian government in the east now where is your non existent list of scholars what a moronian during the first world war and the ensuing years the armenian dictatorship through a premeditated and systematic genocide tried to complete its centuries old policy of annihilation against the turks and kurds by savagely murdering million muslims and deporting the rest from their year homeland this paragraph is well written and interesting serdar baby but it has nothing to do with jews in latvia i have not presented a list of scholars how could you because there is none i am not interested in an ex soviet why do you write x it s very cute armenian government non fascist or otherwise you are not responding to what i am writing instead you are autoposting your own particular brand of bullshit like conversing with a brick wall and you are not responding to what i am writing by the way that bullshit is justly regarded as the first instance of genocide in the th century acted upon an entire people for nearly one thousand years the turkish and kurdish people lived on their homeland the last one hundred under the oppressive soviet and armenian occupation the persecutions culminated in the armenian government planned and carried out a genocide against its muslim subjects million turks and kurds were murdered and the remainder driven out of their homeland after one thousand years turkish and kurdish lands were empty of turks and kurds the survivors found a safe heaven in turkiye today x soviet armenian government rejects the right of turks and kurds to return to their muslim lands occupied by x soviet armenia today x soviet armenia covers up the genocide perpetrated by its predecessors and is therefore an accessory to this crime against humanity x soviet armenia must pay for its crime of genocide against the muslims by admitting to the crime and making reparations to the turks and kurds you have now done so four times in a row may i legitimately conclude that you are not indeed a regular net user but an auto posting computer program which for convenience i have called mutlu exe you may assert whatever you wish here we go with mutlu exe s famed list of sources ditto the attempt at genocide is justly regarded as the first instance of genocide in the th century acted upon an entire people this event is incontrovertibly proven by historians government and international political leaders such as u s ambassador mark bristol and on and on for lines and still anxiously awaiting so the list goes on and on and on i m still trying to find out about those jews in latvia can you post those documents pleeeeeeease mr argic puh leeze could

remember the issue at hand is the armenian nazi collaboration during world war ii and the turkish genocide and i still fail to see how you can challenge the following western sources source john dewey the new republic vol nov pp happy the minority jews which has had no christian nation to protect it and one recalls that the jews took up their abode in fanatic turkey when they were expelled from europe especially spain by saintly christians and they have lived here for centuries in at least as much tranquility and liberty as their fellow turkish subjects all being exposed alike to the rapacity of their common rulers to one brought up as most americans have been in the gladstonian and foreign missionary tradition the condition of the jews in turkey is almost a mathematical demonstration that religious differences have had an influence in the tragedy of turkey only as they were combined with aspirations for a political separation which every nation in the world would have treated as treasonable one readily reaches the conclusion that the jews in turkey were fortunate he also stated that they armenians traitorously turned turkish cities over to the russian invader that they boasted of having raised an army of one hundred and fifty thousand men to fight a civil war and that they burned at least a hundred turkish villages and exterminated their population i want the documents of jews in latvia i think several other people on soc culture greek are already disputing with you about the turkish genocide is this the joke of the month who when how where what a

van on may and organized and carried out a general slaughter of the local muslim population during the next two days while the small ottoman garrison had to retreat to the southern side of the lake knowing their numbers would never justify their territorial ambitions armenians looked to russia and europe for the fulfillment of their aims armenian treachery in this regard culminated at the beginning of the first world war with the decision of the revolutionary organizations to refuse to serve their state the ottoman empire and to assist instead other invading russian armies their hope was their participation in the russian success would be rewarded with an independent armenian state carved out of ottoman territories armenian political leaders army officers and common soldiers began deserting in droves with the russian invasion of eastern anatolia in at the beginning of world war i the degree of armenian collaboration with the ottoman s enemy increased drastically ottoman supply lines were cut by guerilla attacks armenian revolutionaries armed armenian civil populations who in turn massacred the muslim population of the province of van in anticipation of expected arrival of

who gives a thunder about your pseudo scholar jokes i am arguing about the armenian nazi colaboration during world war ii any comment argue it with someone else or do not reply to my posts argic my love i am not arguing about the armenian nazi collaboration i do not give a thunder about it i want you to do one of three things a admit that you are not a regular user but a computer autoposting turkish propaganda or b post the documents on jews in latvia or c run away like the coward without a real address that you are and do not reply to my posts it could be perhaps your head wasn t screwed on just right in while the jews were being assembled for their doom in the nazi concentration camps the armenian volunteers in germany formed the first armenian battalion to fight alongside the nazis in this battalion had grown into eight battalions of strong under the command of the former guerilla leader dro the butcher who was the former dictator of the short lived armenian dictatorship and the architect of the cold blooded genocide of million turks and kurds between an armenian national council was formed by the notorious dashnak party leaders in berlin which was recognized by the nazis encouraged by this the armenians summarily formed a provisional government that endorsed and espoused fully the principles of the nazis and declared themselves as the members of the aryan super race and full participants to hitler s policy of extermination of the jews this armenian nazi conspiracy against the jews during wwii was an encore performance staged by the armenians during wwi when they back stabbed and exterminated million turks by colluding with the invading russian army furthermore as mccarthy put it the armenian dictatorship was granted a respite when the ottomans admitted defeat and signed the mudros armistice with the allies october the allies had decided to create a greater armenia including the old russian province of yerevan and adjoining areas as well as most parts of anatolia claimed by the armenian fanatics only the area called cilicia around the ottoman province of adana was to be excluded as it had already been claimed by the french the allies quickly set about attempting to disarm ottoman soldiers and other turks who could be expected to oppose their plans on april the british army occupied kars gave civilian and military power over to the armenians then withdrew the british planned for kars to be included in the armenian dictatorship even though the russian pre war census had shown kars province to be over muslim the turks of kars were effectively disarmed but the british could not disarm the kurds of the mountains the fate of the turks was almost an exact replica of what had occurred earlier in eastern anatolia murder pillage genocide and the destruction of turkish homes and entire turkish villages drove the turks of kars to the mountains or south and west to the safety afforded by remaining units of the ottoman army the british had left the scene to the armenian genocide squads therefore few europeans were present to observe the genocide one british soldier colonel rawlinson who was assigned to supervise the disarmament of otoman soldiers saw what was occurring rawlinson wired to his superiors in the interest of humanity the armenians should not be left in independent command of the moslim population as their troops being without discipline and not being under effective control atrocities were constantly being committed instead you post more armenian nonsense come again these european dashnags with headquarters in berlin appealed to lines deleted why no wonder you are in such a mess here are the armenian sources on the turkish holocaust lines deleted why list of dead armenians lines deleted obrother spell it

general odishelidje commander of the russian caucasian army armenians are entering every place evacuated by russians carrying out murders cruelties rape and all kind of atrocities which cannot be expressed in writing murdering all the women children aged people who happen to be in the street these barbarous murders repeated every day with new methods continue and the russian army has been urged to intervene to terminate these atrocities public opinion is appalled and horrified newspapers are describing the happenings as shocking we have decided to inform all our friends urgently about the situation document no archive no cabin no drawer no file no section no contents no to acting supreme command commander rd army general the situation in the cities of erzincan and erzurum which we have recently taken over is given below these two beautiful cities of our country which are alike in the calamities and destruction which they suffered have been destroyed as the specially designed and built public and private buildings of these cities were deliberately burnt by armenians apart from the destruction suffered during the two year russian occupation all barracks buildings of erzincan the cavalry barracks in erzurum the government building and army corps headquarters are among those burnt in short both cities are burnt destroyed and trees cut down as to the people of these cities all people old enough to use weapons rounded up taken to the sarikamis direction for road building and were slaughtered the remaining people were subject to cruelties and murder by armenians following the withdrawal of russians and were partly annihilated the corpses thrown into wells burnt in houses mutilated by bayonets their abdomens ripped open in slaughterhouses their lungs and livers torn out girls and women hung up by their hair after all kinds of devilish acts the few people who were able to survive these cruelties worse than those of the spanish inquisition are in poverty more dead than alive horrified some driven insane about in erzincan and in erzurum the people are hungry and in poverty for whatever they had has been taken away from them their lands left uncultivated the people have just been able to exist with some provisions found in stores left over from the russians the villages round erzincan and erzurum are in the worst condition some villages on the road have been leveled to the ground leaving no stone the people completely massacred let me submit to your information with deep grief and regret that history has never before witnessed cruelties at such dimensions a long list a long list and still anxiously awaiting serdar argic we closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as ways of escape for the turks and then
